## Mah Portfolio ##

Hello! This is my portfolio where I will be uploading things I make from now on weather they are good or not.

It might not attract a lot of attention but I personally will be doing this for myself if you don't like something you can move on thank you for your time!

It's also a place for me to be me and not be judged

## SIDE NOTE ##

After this huge discord hack with 70,000 GOVERNMENT IDS STOLEN I think I wanna get into cyber security. I don't get why people would even think about leaking
hundreds or thousands of minor IDS knowing that predators will abuse this knowledge. I will do what I can to learn cyber security and teach anyone I come across how to
protect themselves online. May you all stay safe and monitor where your information goes.

Remember your information is everywhere online, you can't delete it but you can protect yourself.
