## Browsers ##

# Tor Browser #

# FireFox #
Price: Free
My Thoughts: Very cool I haven't used it much but it has a built in vpn so that's cool

# Falkon #
Price: Free (Comes as default for KDE plasma)
My Thoughts: I don't have many doesn't support rendering so some pages dont work, has no book marks, word look ups, or a proper password saving thing, its kinda a baseplate just to search but it's pretty secure as it's not owwned by a big company
