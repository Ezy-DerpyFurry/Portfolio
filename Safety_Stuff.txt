# Windscribe #
Price: Free - $9.00/Month
App/Web: Application vpn
My Thoughts: I've never used it, I don't know how it is but I heard through someone else it was good.
Website: https://windscribe.com/download/

Sidenote: I know theres paid ones like nord vpn and stuff but that's paid and overly talked about

## Browsers ##

# Tor Browser #
Price: Free
My Thoughts: Super good for security though some times it can be a little to over kill it had 3 vpn gate ways and onionized versions of sites plus 3 levels of security (Optional)
Website: https://www.torproject.org/download/

# FireFox #
Price: Free
My Thoughts: Very cool I haven't used it much but it has a built in vpn so that's cool
Website: https://www.firefox.com/en-US/browsers/desktop/windows/

# Falkon #
Price: Free (Comes as default for KDE plasma)
My Thoughts: I don't have many doesn't support rendering so some pages dont work, has no book marks, word look ups, or a proper password saving thing, its kinda a baseplate just to search but it's pretty secure as it's not owwned by a big company
Website: https://www.falkon.org/download/

# Chrome #
Price: Free
My Thoughts: I use it mainly cause it has huge support on extensions and websites, I don't personally trust google with anything I don't save important passwords on it or log into important stuff
Website: https://www.google.com/chrome/

Sidenote: Browsers are browsers most use chromium or another big open source thing the browser doesn't make all that much different other than where it saves passwords and local stuff but DuckDuck go is used on alot of things same with chromium
