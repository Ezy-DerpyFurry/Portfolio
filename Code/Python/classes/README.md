Part 1
Write a program in Python using PythonAnywhere that satisfies each of the following requirements:

1. Assign a value to a variable // Makes sense
2. Print text and a variable // Also makes sense good for learning
3. Get a decimal number from the user // Oki? I guess makes sense learnign floats early on
4. Perform a mathematical calculation on a variable // ok what? why complex why not say "do a math equation with a variable" why confused your students?
5. Demonstrate the use of a comma and a plus sign in a print statement (doesn’t have to be the same print statement) // doesn't this just go with uhm... number 4?....
6. Use comments explaining what data type each of the variables hold // This is like saying explain why 1 + 2 = 3 don't get me wrong its good to notation but your not like "float = 2.0 # This is a float!"

Part 2
Write an algorithm in pseudocode that calculates the phone bill of a user based on how many minutes and texts they have used. 
Their phone company charges than $0.10 per minute and $0.05 per text. Plus, they have to pay a monthly base fee of $8. Tell the user how much they must pay that month.

Write your algorithm using a word processing document. Convert your algorithm to Python code using PythonAnywhere. 
Be sure to use the correct syntax for printing their total with a dollar sign.

Sample algorithm:

  INPUT minutes
  INPUT texts
  total = minutes * .1 + texts * .05 + 8 // Just gave away the answer using proper math symbols good job!
  OUTPUT “You must pay ” + total // why use + ? ur not doign a math equation and u dont add a int to a string what?
  
^^ Dis is a beginners class so what I did was way more complicated also things after // are my thongs on the rules.
