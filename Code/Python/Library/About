These are my documents/examples for my upcoming Library for python, it will use C++ and python and multiple libraries like ydl, ffmpeg and others its gonna be one big wrapper for python covering.
It will cover video/music playing, guis, extra functions simplified, file handling all for you to make python 10 times easier while still being efficient.

Classes:
  Music
  Extras

### About Threading ###
Most/All functions will forcefully use the threading library or in simple terms will not pause your code, meaning if you have a play it will execute the rest of the code but will not stop the code as I have
put a monitor downloading does stop your code as of right now due to me being bad.

### Libraries ###
All the libraries are not built by me I'm simply makign a wrapper to make things easier to use.

Libraries:
  import yt_dlp
  import ctypes
  from yt_dlp.utils import DownloadError
  import threading
