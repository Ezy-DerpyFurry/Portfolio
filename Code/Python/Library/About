These are my documents/examples for my Library/Wrapper for python, it will use C++ and python and multiple libraries like ydl, ffmpeg and others its gonna be one big wrapper for python covering.
It will cover video/music playing, guis, extra functions simplified, file handling all for you to make python 10 times easier while still being efficient.

The .so file might not be fully found so please replace it with the full .so path if your IDE doesn't support relative paths.

Classes:
  Music
  Extras
  Math
  Video
  File

### Libraries ###
All the libraries are not built by me I'm simply making a wrapper to make things easier to use.

Libraries:
  import yt_dlp
  import ctypes
  from yt_dlp.utils import DownloadError
  import threading
  import os
  import warnings
  import vlc


### About Threading ###
Most functions will forcefully use the threading library, or in simple terms will not pause your code on execution.

### About my toint function ###
It handles everything for you such as strings, floats, ints and converts them to a integer or a string for you depending on your need and the last function f=True/False floatifys it if your working on
velocity and need it to be a float.
