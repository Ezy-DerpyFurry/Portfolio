[I am infact updating it to support a much bigger terminal ui to include extra functions needed such as clearing terminal easily
Executing command lines while in the ui so you don't need to close it to execute console commands while running it.
For example if you were in a python terminal ui using it to organize files or what not and you needed to run ls somewhere you could add a function to execute ls in different places.

This is being developed on a linux computer for linux sorry windows users (as if anyone ever sees this github :p) as always I'll display the code.]

^^ OLD ^^

It is now released? or what ever yayy! :3 aaanyways it only works for linux as I only use linux sorry..... You can look at the code and make your own for windows.
