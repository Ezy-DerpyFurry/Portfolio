Sooo this is a katana I made with ***ZERO*** reference am really proud of it I think there are tons of improvements of course but am learning :3
Anyways in the rendered image I forgot to smooth the background and the point lights were off with the double shadow sowwies but my computer can cook an egg right now so 
not rendering it again
